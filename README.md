# RESTful Service in TS (initial structure)
RESTful service intended for design-time benchmarking of workflows. 

The service was integrated into RESTful APE (as the architecture was changed), and thus this project is **discontinued** and **archived**.



The initial setup followed [this](https://medium.com/@kishore-17/building-a-rest-api-with-typescript-express-js-and-with-dependency-injection-pattern-2e5994998493) tutorial.
